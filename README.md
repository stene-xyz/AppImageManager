# AppImageManager
AppImage Manager (AIM for short) is a basic package manager for AppImage files.  
It is currently in beta due to a lack of features (and a lack of included packages)  

## Requirements
- Some flavor of x86 Linux
- Python 3.8 or later
- BASH (if you don't know what this is, you probably already use it.)

## Installation
Run the `install.sh` script as root.

## Usage
`aim <install/remove> <package list>`
